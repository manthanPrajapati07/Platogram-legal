<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use the Plant Watering Reminder, Growth Tracker, and Plant Care App.</p>

<h2>1. Information You Provide</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal data. Any information you enter—such as plant names, watering schedules, care notes, or growth logs—remains on your device and, if enabled, in your iCloud storage.</p>

<h2>2. Cloud Backup and Data Storage</h2>
<p>If you activate cloud backup, your plant-related data is securely stored in your private iCloud account managed by Apple CloudKit. We cannot view, edit, or access this data at any time.</p>

<h2>3. Notifications and Reminders</h2>
<p>The app sends custom reminders only after you grant permission. Notification data stays on your device and is never transmitted externally.</p>

<h2>4. Subscription & Payment Information</h2>
<p>All payments, subscriptions, and billing information are handled entirely by Apple via StoreKit. We do not process or store any financial or personal payment data.</p>

<h2>5. Analytics & Tracking</h2>
<p>This app does not use analytics, advertising frameworks, or third-party tracking tools. We do not monitor usage behavior.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>Your data benefits from Apple’s robust system-level security. Plant data stored in iCloud is encrypted and protected by your Apple ID.</p>

<h2>7. Your Control Over Data</h2>
<p>You may delete plant data at any time through the app. You may also disable cloud backup or notifications whenever you choose.</p>

<h2>8. Policy Updates</h2>
<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to clarify practices or comply with legal requirements. Continued use means you accept any changes.</p>
