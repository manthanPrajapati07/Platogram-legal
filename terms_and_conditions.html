<h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p>These Terms and Conditions govern the use of our Plant Watering Reminder, Growth Tracker, and Plant Care App. By installing or using the app, you accept these terms.</p>

<h2>1. Purpose of the App</h2>
<p>This app helps you track plant growth, manage watering schedules, receive reminders, and monitor plant health using charts and insights. It is intended for personal plant care use.</p>

<h2>2. Cloud Backup Service</h2>
<p>The cloud backup feature uses Apple's secure iCloud service to store and sync your plant-related data across devices. This requires an active iCloud account and sufficient iCloud storage.</p>

<h2>3. Notification Reminder System</h2>
<p>The app allows you to set custom reminders for watering and plant care. Notifications function only when allowed in your device settings.</p>

<h2>4. Premium Features & Subscriptions</h2>
<p>The app offers optional premium tools, including unlimited plant tracking, advanced charts, custom reminders, and cloud backup. These features require a subscription managed by Apple’s App Store.</p>
<p>Subscriptions auto‑renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the renewal date.</p>

<h2>5. Data Handling</h2>
<p>All data you enter is stored locally on your device and optionally synced through your iCloud account. We do not collect, store, or sell personal data.</p>

<h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Users must ensure the accuracy of their own plant data, maintain their iCloud account, and manage their subscription preferences directly within Apple settings.</p>

<h2>7. App Modifications</h2>
<p>We may update the app or these Terms at any time to improve performance, add features, or comply with legal requirements. Continued use indicates agreement to any updates.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Information</h2>
<p>If you require assistance, please reach out via the support email listed on our App Store page.</p>
